# 𝐋𝐚𝐓𝐞𝐗 Templates

My personal collection of LaTeX templates.

* ✒️ **Novel** [[example](./examples/novel-example.pdf)] \
    A minimal template to share a novel with a title page, a copyright page, and a table of contents at the end.
* ✒️ **Short Story** [[example](./examples/short-story-example.pdf)] \
    A simple template for writing short stories, forked from Novel template but without the table of contents and the chapter management.

## Build example with `pdflatex`

```bash
cd short-story
pdflatex main.tex
```

You should see a `main.pdf` file in the `short-story` directory.
